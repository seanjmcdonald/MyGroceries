Managing Remotes / Changing a remote's URL
 
How can we help?

Changing a remote's URL
MAC WINDOWS LINUX ALL
The git remote set-url command changes an existing remote repository URL.

Tip: For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see "Which remote URL should I use?"

The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name. For example, origin or upstream are two common choices.
A new URL for the remote. For example:

If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:

https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:

git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS
Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the git remote set-url command.

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
Verify that the remote URL has changed.

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
The next time you git fetch, git pull, or git push to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you must create a personal access token to use instead of your GitHub password.
You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.
Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH
Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the git remote set-url command.

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
Verify that the remote URL has changed.

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Troubleshooting
You may encounter these errors when trying to change a remote.

No such remote '[name]'
This error means that the remote you tried to change doesn't exist:

git remote set-url sofake https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
fatal: No such remote 'sofake'
Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.
